# Year Filter Fix - Test Cases

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Function Definition
- **Problem**: Two `filterTableDataByYears` functions were defined, and the simpler one was being used
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate function and kept the comprehensive one with better year detection

### 2. Poor Year Column Detection
- **Problem**: Simple function only checked `selectedYears.includes(Number(header))` which failed for many cases
- **Solution**: Added 4 detection methods:
  - Method 1: Direct integer parsing
  - Method 2: Substring matching
  - Method 3: Regex pattern matching
  - Method 4: Exact string matching

### 3. Select All Years Inconsistency
- **Problem**: "Select All" button used global available years instead of years from selected tables
- **Solution**: Updated to use `currentAvailableYears` from selected tables

## Test Cases to Verify

### Test Case 1: Single Year Selection
1. Load sample data (button: "Load Sample Data")
2. Select 2 tables in Step 2
3. In Step 3, select only 2022
4. **Expected**: Preview should show only columns: "Kabupaten/Kota" and "2022"
5. **Expected**: Both tables should have exactly 2 columns

### Test Case 2: Multiple Year Selection
1. Load sample data
2. Select 2 tables
3. Select years: 2020, 2022, 2023
4. **Expected**: Preview should show columns: "Kabupaten/Kota", "2020", "2022", "2023"
5. **Expected**: Both tables should have exactly 4 columns

### Test Case 3: Select All Years
1. Load sample data
2. Select 2 tables
3. Click "Select All Years"
4. **Expected**: All years (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023) should be selected
5. **Expected**: Both tables should show all 5 columns (region + 4 years)
6. **Expected**: First table should NOT show all years while second shows only first year

### Test Case 4: Filter Verification
1. After selecting years, use the "üîç Verify Filtering" button in Step 4
2. **Expected**: Console should show that filtering verification PASSED
3. **Expected**: No "Missing years" or "Extra years" errors

## Sample Data Structure
```
Headers: ["Kabupaten/Kota", "2020", "2021", "2022", "2023"]
Data rows with values for each year
```

## Console Debugging
- Look for messages starting with üîç, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå, üìã, üìä
- Should see "Successfully filtered from X to Y columns" messages
- Should see "Including column N: 'YEAR'" for each selected year
